GIT -- Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code or files over time. It's mainly used by developers to collaborate on software development.

 Key Points About Git:

    Distributed Version Control System (DVCS): Every developer has a full copy of the project history.

    Tracks changes: You can go back to previous versions.

    Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.

    Branching and Merging: Easily try new ideas using branches, then merge them back.

Why Git is Important:

    Helps avoid losing work.

    Useful when collaborating with a team.

    Keeps a full history of your project.

    Used in DevOps, open-source projects, software companies, etc.
