Ip address :  is used to generate to provide unique address to provide for particular
              to device that is  connected network..


Subnet : Adv -- security, privacy, isolation..
         they arre divided into 2 types
         1. private -- does not access to internet
         2.public --  has access to internet


VPC -- Virtual Private Cloud.

Itâ€™s a private network environment within a public cloud platform (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) where you can launch and manage resources (such as servers, databases, etc.) in a logically isolated section of the provider's infrastructure.

 
CDIR range -- CIDR range means Classless Inter-Domain Routing range. It is a method used to allocate IP addresses and routing IP packets more efficiently than the old class-based system (Class A, B, C).



A CIDR block is written like this:
192.168.0.0/24

This means:

    192.168.0.0 is the network address.

    /24 is the prefix length, which shows how many bits are used for the network part.

 What CIDR Range Means:

    It defines a range of IP addresses in a network.

    The smaller the number after the slash, the bigger the network.

    The larger the number, the smaller the network.

Why CIDR is Useful:

    Helps with IP address efficiency.

    Allows flexible subnetting.

    Reduces waste of IPs.

    Used in VPCs, subnets, firewalls, routing tables in AWS and other cloud services.
